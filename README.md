# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 💓

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using machine learning models trained on clinical data. It explores multiple supervised learning algorithms to determine the most effective model for early risk detection.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally. Early prediction can help in timely medical intervention. This project leverages patient data to build models that classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, etc.
- Target: Presence of heart disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
